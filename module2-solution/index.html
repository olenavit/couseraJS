            <h3>Madara</h3>
            <p>&quot;As long as the concept of winners
                exists, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars, and hatred is
                born to protect love.&quot;</p>

            <h3>Nagato</h3>
            <p>&quot;War brings death. And wounds and pain to both sides. There’s nothing harder to accept, than
                the deaths of those you love. So you believe they could never die.&quot;</p>

            <h3>Jiraiya</h3>
            <p>&quot;Rejection is a part of any man’s life. If you can’t accept and move past rejection,
                or at least use it as writing material – you’re not a real man.&quot;</p>
